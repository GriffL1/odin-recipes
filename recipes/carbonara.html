        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
                    <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
                    <li>3 eggs</li>
                    <li>10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided</li>
                    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; 
                        add guanciale (see Cook's Note). 
                        Cook, turning occasionally, 
                        until evenly browned and crispy, 
                        5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on 
                        paper towels.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
                        Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, 
                        stirring occasionally until tender yet firm 
                        to the bite, about 9 minutes. 
                        Drain and return to the pot. 
                        Let cool, stirring occasionally, 
                        about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Whisk eggs, half of the Pecorino Romano cheese, 
                        and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and 
                        creamy. Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring 
                        quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. 
                        Stir in guanciale. Top with remaining Pecorino 
                        Romano cheese and more black pepper.</li>
                </ol>
